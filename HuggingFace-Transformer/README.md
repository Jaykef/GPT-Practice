# 🤗 Transformers
State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

🤗 Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

📝 Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
🖼️ Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
🗣️ Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
🐙 Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

🤗 Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This provides the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a model’s life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework, and load it for inference in another. Models can also be exported to a format like ONNX and TorchScript for deployment in production environments.Ω
